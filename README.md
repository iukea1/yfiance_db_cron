## Features

- **Data Retrieval:** Fetch daily, weekly, or intraday stock data from Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`.
- **SQLite Storage:** A structured database schema to store stock metadata, price history, dividends, splits, etc.
- **Configurable:** Easily extend or modify the schema and scripts to suit specific trading or analytical needs.
- **Secure & Offline Analysis:** By storing data locally, you reduce reliance on the network and can perform analyses offline.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** (Recommended 3.10+ for modern syntax and type hints)
- [**yfinance**](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance)
- [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- **sqlite3** (built-in with Python, no separate installation needed)
- (Optional) [**SQLAlchemy**](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) if you prefer an ORM approach

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas
```


Thought about stock database schema design for 4 seconds

Below is an example project description, a sample `README.md`, and a suggested SQLite database schema that can store stock data pulled using [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance).

## Project Description

**Project Name:** Stock Data Collector

**Overview:**
The Stock Data Collector project fetches historical and real-time stock data using the [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) library and stores it into a local SQLite database. This allows users to persist stock data for analysis, backtesting, or other financial applications without relying on external APIs in real-time.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Fetching:** Leverages `yfinance` to pull daily, weekly, or intraday stock data.
2. **Database Storage:** Saves fetched stock data into a well-structured SQLite database.
3. **Historical and Current Data:** Supports storing both historical and updated data points, including dividends, stock splits, and more.
4. **Easy to Extend:** Built with modular design so additional functionality (e.g., advanced data analytics, charting) can be added later.

**Use Cases:**

* Academic or personal finance research
* Data analysis and visualization
* Backtesting trading strategies in Python
* Integration with machine learning pipelines
